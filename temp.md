❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum (){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined as parameters to the function. This will likely result in an error or unexpected
behavior if `a` and `b` are not defined in the scope where the function is called.
* ❌ The function doesn't have input parameters, limiting its reusability.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ The function now takes `a` and `b` as parameters, making it clear what inputs are expected.
* ✔ This change makes the function reusable and avoids potential errors caused by relying on variables from the outer
scope. It adheres to best practices by explicitly defining the function's dependencies.
